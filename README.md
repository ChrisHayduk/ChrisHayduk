# Hi there, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently the Lead ML Engineer for Drug Discovery at Deloitte, where I work to develop, orchestrate, and deploy deep learning models to accelerate pharmaceutical research and development.

In my free time, I build large language model (LLM) powered tools, develop open source LLM models and datasets, and contribute to LLM research projects.

## ðŸ’» Github Projects 

I've worked on several LLM-focused projects featured on GitHub:

- [QLoRA for Masked Language Modeling](https://github.com/ChrisHayduk/QLoRA-for-MLM) - Updated QLoRA for use with the masked language modeling objective, enabling efficient finetuning of BERT-family models
- [Multi-GPU QLoRA](https://github.com/ChrisHayduk/qlora-multi-gpu) - Updated QLoRA to allow for distributed data parallel finetuning, significantly accelerating finetuning workloads
- [Athena.ai](https://github.com/ChrisHayduk/athena.ai) - Leveraged GPT-4 and ChromaDB to create a personal knowledge management and chat tool
- [Multimodal Llama Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/ChrisHayduk/Multimodal-Llama-Reinforcement-Learning) - A repo designed to create a reinforcement learning agent using only a multimodal LLaMA model
